Hey, I'm @gongonth, but I usually go by Nerdinator online. I'm a beginner programmer, just learning to code.
I've done some basic python to help me in my statitics classes, and am currently taking some intro CS classes at my university,
where we are learning c#. I am interesting in expanding my programming knowledge in all aspects, as it is very basic.

I am currently working through my university CS classes, as well as several programming books I've sourced on my own.
I am also experimenting with some pro micro controllers to help me customise my mechanical keyboards.
